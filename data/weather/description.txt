Hello,

Here you will find the files which were used to calculate the Temperature and Humidity values for their corresponding columns in the Core data folder.

The order of operation in which the folders are used are as follows:

         ___________________
        |                   |    This is when the files have been downloaded from the weather website, and nothing has been done with them.
        |        raw        |    At this stage, all information is in a very confusing and hard to interpret format, while technically usable, checking for errors
        |___________________|    within the data (either on the end of the website, or through the processing by the code) would be substantially more difficult.
            |           |
          __|           |__
          \               /
           \             /
            \           /
         ___________________
        |                   |    At this point, the dataset has been broken up from its hard to read format into something you would normally expect in a .csv file.
        |    unprocessed    |    By this I mean the data split across the columns, rather than the reality of the raw data which is either randomly clumpted together in
        |___________________|    one column, or split across two or more columns.
            |           |
          __|           |__
          \               /
           \             /
            \           /
         ___________________
        |                   |    Finally, it now only contains only the average temperature (T) and humidity (U) for each day. Resulting in the dataset now being significantly
        |     processed     |    more smaller, and matching the desired chronological order of dates such that it can be copied and pasted over into the main datasets.

        |                   |    Over the course of reading the weather data, there will undoubtably be cases where there are errors in the data (mainly missing temperature and humidity   
        |      error s      |    readings). This is just for the sake of keeping a record of where these occur, and may be able to provide an answer for why the data is the way it is.
