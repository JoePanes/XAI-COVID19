Hello,

In the following folders you will find the dataset in various stages of preprocessing.

The order of operation in which the folders are used are as follows:

         ___________________
        |                   |    This is the data in a human-orientated format, it uses things like strings of text when representing information.
        |        raw        |
        |___________________|
            |           |
          __|           |__
          \               /
           \             /
            \           /
         ___________________
        |                   |    At this stage, any strings have been mapped to a their numerical equivalent, and fields that offer highly variable numbers 
        |     processed     |    have been discretized.
        |___________________|
            |           |
          __|           |__
          \               /
           \             /
            \           /
         ___________________
        |                   |   Here the processed information has now been used to calculate the R value throughout the dataset, with the resultant value 
        |        R t        |   for each day added to the row in a new column.
        |___________________|
            |           |
          __|           |__
          \               /
           \             /
            \           /
         ___________________
        |                   |   Here, the Rt data is taken, then the remainder discretizing is performed on: Cases, Cases Cumulative, Deaths, Deaths Cumulative,
        |       final       |   Tests, Tests Cumulative, Rt. Which is done using K-Means.

        |                   |    While reading in the core dataset, it is useful to know where there may be some human errors within the dataset (e.g. missing or 
        |      error s      |    mistyped data). Therefore, this helps keep a log of where issues have arisen while converting the data so that the user can more easily
        |___________________|    rectify any errors that would otherwise be easily missed.
